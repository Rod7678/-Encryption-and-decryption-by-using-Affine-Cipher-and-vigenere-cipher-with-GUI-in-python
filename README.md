# Encryption-and-decryption-by-using-Affine-Cipher-and-vigenere-cipher-with-GUI-in-python
The Encryption and Decryption Project with Affine Cipher and Vigenere Cipher in Python involves creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application to facilitate the secure encoding and decoding of messages.
The Affine Cipher, known for its mathematical encryption method, and the Vigenere Cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, are implemented to enhance data security.
The user-friendly GUI allows individuals to input text, choose a cipher method (Affine or Vigenere), enter encryption keys, and receive the corresponding encrypted or decrypted output. This project not only emphasizes the practical application of cryptography but also provides an intuitive interface, making it accessible for users without a deep understanding of cryptographic algorithms. The combination of encryption methods and a user-friendly GUI aims to offer a versatile and educational tool for individuals interested in secure communication practices using Python.
